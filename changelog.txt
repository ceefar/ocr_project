[day-1]

- setup window display basics
- setup initial user name image manipulation (slice/crop, save, resize, etc)
- setup preprocessing (greyscale, considered blur but have removed it now)
- setup threshold initial test choices (will run 5 or 6 thresholds to start alongside more advanced preprocessing and img manipulation in future to prepare images for ocr)
- setup initial ocr
- use ocr to username to img filename string
- adds name to filename string
- spend most time checking a few tutorials, reading up on ocr, and then testing things out and playing around with things initially, as well as a quick catch up on matplotlib since is useful for plotting
