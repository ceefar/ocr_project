[day-1]

- setup window display basics
- setup initial user name image manipulation (slice/crop, save, resize, etc)
- setup preprocessing (greyscale, considered blur but have removed it now)
- setup threshold initial test choices (will run 5 or 6 thresholds to start alongside more advanced preprocessing and img manipulation in future to prepare images for ocr)
- setup initial ocr
- use ocr to username to img filename string
- adds name to filename string
- spend most time checking a few tutorials, reading up on ocr, and then testing things out and playing around with things initially, as well as a quick catch up on matplotlib since is useful for plotting

[day-2]

- had to sign up at a new gym, plus a hospital apt so starting working late
- again lot of experimenting beforehand
- setup basic test environment with test images
- now accurately saving usernames and saving images in organised folders of user data 
- moved imgs to test_imgs folder
- removed manual looping
    - now dynamically loops through all files in test_imgs folder in main()

[day-3-saturday]

- working on preprocessing mostly today
- added test.py, improved preprocessing to pfp test images, now working on the previously not working test_1 img, now to test the rest 
- various, to add like addition of basic validation, other extra qa things, etc
- basic qa

[day-4-sunday]

- using test imgs path for looping in new ocr_test, so testing 25 images now
- added succesful extractions to qa + so general light improvements to qa section
- added crop functionality, as above 25 test imgs, we now take the original images and crop them (instead of taking the pre-cropped img while testing)
- improved crop functionality with switch for various required image sections for pfp page
- improved qa
- currently at an improved 70% success rate with ocr extraction on names and actually is slightly higher as 2 user names have hanzi characters 
    - after checking, actually currently at an 80% success x accuracy rate (by that i mean the success rate for 100% accuracy of ocr)
